[scDHMap](https://github.com/ttgump/scDHMap) is a model-based deep learning approach to visualize the complex hierarchical structures of single-cell sequencing data in a low dimensional hyperbolic space. 

scDHMap can be used for various dimensionality reduction tasks including revealing trajectory branches, batch correction, and denoising highly dropout counts.
